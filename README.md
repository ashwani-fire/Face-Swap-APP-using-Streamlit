# Face-Swap-APP-using-Streamlit
A Face Swap App using pre trained model(68 shape ddetector) 
This App is an example of using simple transformations, I used affine transformation, First I used Delaunay Triangulation for meshing then i used warp affine function to get the matrix then i appied the affine transformation. 
Just google 68 shape detector you will get the model. its 95MB i cant upload here
